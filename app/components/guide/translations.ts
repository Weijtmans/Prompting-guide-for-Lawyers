        "This prompting guide provides an overview of key prompting techniques specifically for legal work. Prompting is the art of formulating effective questions and instructions for AI tools. The better your prompt, the more relevant and useful the output.\n\nEffective prompting increases the quality of legal analyses, saves time in document processing, and helps structure complex legal questions. Techniques range from simple instructions to advanced (conversational) methods.\n\nHow to use this guide?\nStart with the fundamental techniques, experiment with different tactics, and gradually gain experience. The examples are directly applicable to your daily practice.",

      warningContent:
        "AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are not designed for legal research. They do not have access to legal sources (such as current laws, regulations, or case law). When asking about specific articles, rulings, or regulations, there is a high risk of hallucinations: the AI invents convincingly sounding but factually incorrect information.\n\nFor reliable legal research, you have two options:\n1. Attach the relevant legal texts, case law, or other legal sources to your prompt yourself, so the AI can only draw from reliable material.\n2. Use a specialized legal AI tool that has access to current legal databases\n\nNever blindly trust AI output for legal questions without verifying it with reliable sources.",
